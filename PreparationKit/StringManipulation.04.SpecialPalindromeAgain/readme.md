A string is said to be a special palindromic string if either of two conditions is met:

All of the characters are the same, e.g. aaa.
All characters except the middle one are the same, e.g. aadaa.
A special palindromic substring is any substring of a string which meets one of those criteria. Given a string, determine how many special palindromic substrings can be formed from it.

For example, given the string , we have the following special palindromic substrings: .

Function Description
